# Development

## Setup

Run `npm install && npm test && npm run link-local` in the root folder to
install and test and link everything.

In the packages/core/ folder `npm run test:only` will run unit tests
without linting and more.

## Debugging

The [Test Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) extension will give you an overview of tests as well as codelens above each test to run/debug.
